Please Note: Briefly discuss means one or two sentences.
1. Solve the following least squares problem with two Householder reflections using the matlab
routine house303. You should need two Householder reflections.
Ax =

Hint: Put A and b in a 5 × 3 augmented matrix A with A as the first two columns and b as the
third. Do two Householder reflections on A to get the first two columns of A into row echelon
form, yielding R. The third column of A will automatically be QT b.
Without explicitly forming the residual vector r = b − Ax, what is the length of r at the least
squares solution?
2. A ridge regression problem has a design matrix A and right hand side vector b as follows
A =




2 −1 1
1 0 1
0 1 1
−1 2 1

 and b =


Do the following using hand calculations:
(a) Calculate AT A.
(b) Show that the following three vectors are the eigenvectors of AT A and find the corre-
sponding eigenvalues.
v1 =


1

 v2 =




 and v3 =



0


(c) What does the smallest of these eigenvalues tell you about AT A?
(d) Find the eigendecomposition QDQT of AT A where Q is orthonormal, and D diagonal.
(NB: Remember to normalize the eigenvectors before constructing Q.)
(e) Using this eigendecomposition, solve the ridge regression equation
AT A + ρI x = AT b
for z = QT x as a function of ρ.
(f) Show ∥x(ρ)∥2 ≤ √0.28 for all positive ρ.

3. This question looks at fitting the function y = 2t+1 at t = −1, 0, and 1.001 using the polynomial
model F (x, t) = x1 + x2t + x3t3. (NB: This model has a cubic term but no quadratic term.)
(a) Use ridgemodel303 to find the least squares (i.e. ρ = 0) fit to the data. Do not centre
the data.
(b) On a separate plot, use ridgemodel303 to find the ridge regression fits for ρ = 10−5, 10−3,
10−1, and 10 again without centering the data. Briefly comment on the how the model
behaves as ρ is increased. (NB: These plots need to be done on a separate plot to the
least squares fit from part (a), otherwise the vertical scale will make it impossible to see
the ridge regression curves.)
(c) Repeat part (b) of this question, but this time centre the data. Briefly comment on the
effect of centering the data on the model’s behaviour as ρ varies.
(d) Using ridgexr303 to plot ∥x∥2, ∥r∥2 and x against ρ for ρ in the range 10−5 ≤ ρ ≤ 10.
Use p = 61 different values of ρ, and do not centre the data. (Hit return to get from one
plot to the next.) The plot of x is a 3D plot, and by holding the left mouse button down
with the cursor on it, you should be able to rotate it to get a good view from several
angles.
i. Briefly discuss the behaviour of ∥x∥2 and ∥r∥2 as ρ increases.
ii. There is an ‘elbow’ in the path of x on the 3D plot. Briefly discuss the ‘elbow’ in
light of the plots from parts(a) and (b) of this question.
NB: On the 3D plot the x for ρ = 10−5 is marked with a red star. To rotate the 3D
plot for a better view, place the cursor on the plot using the mouse, left click and
hold, then move the cursor to rotate.
iii. The log-log plot of ∥x∥2 against ρ also shows three distinct parts. Identify these parts
with parts of the 3D graph showing the path of x.
Hint: The crosses on each graph show the locations of each plotted point. They give an
indication of how quickly x is changing with respect to ρ. With p = 61 every 10 crosses
amounts to a change in ρ of a factor of 10. (p = 31 might also be useful, with 5 crosses
per factor of 10 for ρ.) You can write your answers directly on the plots you generate if it
is helpful.
The matlab routines house303, ridgemodel303, and ridgexr303 are all in the same section as
the assignments on learn. There is also a video on ECHO with the lecture recordings detailing how
to use these three routines.
